------

blank project for a kha game or whatever you want to do in kha.

just to save time having to create states, players etc. its super basic & i will update it will relevant things it should have.

i found myself typing the same thing everytime & while thats good for learning, can become boring if you just want to get on & work.
keyboard & mouse controls are blank as people have different things they deem as important, its just to get people up & running.

have ph√ºn & happy coding

*this project is not in association with street fighter or capcom - though i have spilled most of my childhood playing the game[s]
** i also do not take credit for the GIFs - they are made by WAY more talented people than myself
